# Chicago-Street-Safety-Rating-Prediction
This short clip demonstrates how our software categorizes the roads of Chicago into various risk bands for different times of the day, and different days of the week. Roads which are coloured red possess the highest risk while those coloured green have the least risk. 

The yellow dots represent actual traffic accidents which occurred in the heart of Chicago. Note how these accidents tend to occur along roads which are deemed as risky (in the orange-red spectrum) by our algorithm. Only data from the first week of January 2018 are demonstrated in this video (traffic volume can be seen to fluctuate periodically on the lower right-hand corner).
